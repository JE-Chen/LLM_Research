- Verdict: Do Not Merge
- Reasoning:
  - The PR introduces significant complexity and potential for issues.
  - The code lacks proper documentation and the tests are not comprehensive or provide adequate feedback.
  - The code is high in complexity and may be difficult to understand and maintain.
  - The code does not properly signal exceptions, leading to the assumption that the exceptions will never be signaled. This could cause issues if the exceptions are not handled properly.
- Action Items:
  - Document the code thoroughly, including examples and use cases.
  - Ensure that the tests are comprehensive and provide adequate feedback.
  - Review the code and make necessary changes to reduce complexity.
  - Ensure that exceptions are properly signaled and handled.

Verdict: Do Not Merge

Reasoning:

1. The code does not comply with the agreed coding standards and best practices. The PR introduces changes that could potentially have unintended side effects and could cause issues in the long run.
2. The PR doesn't include any additional tests for the changes. The existing tests could be improved by adding tests for the scenarios where the file is modified during the request.
3. The PR is missing the necessary license agreement.
4. The changes don't align with the project's goals and objectives.

Action Items:

1. Ensure that the code follows the agreed coding standards and best practices.
2. Add the missing tests to validate the changes.
3. Provide the necessary license agreement.
4. Clarify the PR's purpose and goals.
5. Ensure the PR is correctly signed off by the contributor.
6. If not ready, list specific, actionable changes needed.

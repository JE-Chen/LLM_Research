# Code Review Comment Evaluation Template

Please evaluate the review comments using the following scoring mechanism.  
Focus on whether the comments effectively help improve the code, especially by leveraging code smell and linter messages.

Score range: 1–100

Six evaluation dimensions:
1. Readability
    - 1–20: Comments are very hard to understand, poorly structured, confusing language.
    - 21–40: Some parts are readable, but many unclear sections remain.
    - 41–60: Comments are generally clear, but structure or phrasing needs improvement.
    - 61–80: Comments are well-structured, consistent, and easy to follow.
    - 81–100: Comments are highly readable, elegantly phrased, and well-organized.

2. Constructiveness (Maintainability)
    - 1–20: Comments lack constructive suggestions, no improvement direction.
    - 21–40: Comments provide partial suggestions, but vague or impractical.
    - 41–60: Comments offer basic improvement ideas, somewhat helpful.
    - 61–80: Comments are specific and actionable, clearly guiding improvements.
    - 81–100: Comments are highly constructive, offering clear and practical improvement paths.

3. Correctness
    - 1–20: Comments contain errors or misleading advice.
    - 21–40: Mostly correct, but important issues are overlooked.
    - 41–60: Largely correct, with only minor gaps.
    - 61–80: Correct and reasonable, with small room for refinement.
    - 81–100: Fully correct, logically sound, and precise in identifying issues.

4. Conciseness
    - 1–20: Comments are overly long, irrelevant to code improvement.
    - 21–40: Some relevant points, but too much unnecessary content.
    - 41–60: About half of the comments are focused and relevant.
    - 61–80: Most comments are concise and focused on improvement.
    - 81–100: All comments are precise, concise, and directly related to improvement.

5. Comprehensiveness
    - 1–20: Comments fail to address any code smells or linter findings.
    - 21–40: Comments mention at least one code smell or linter warning.
    - 41–60: Comments cover some code smells or linter findings.
    - 61–80: Comments cover most code smells and linter findings.
    - 81–100: Comments comprehensively address all code smells and linter findings, with improvement suggestions.

6. Relevance
    Relevance = (2 * Conciseness * Comprehensiveness) / (Conciseness + Comprehensiveness)

Reviewers should:
- Assign a score (1–100) for each dimension.
- Provide brief reasoning for each score.
- Conclude with an average score and overall recommendation.

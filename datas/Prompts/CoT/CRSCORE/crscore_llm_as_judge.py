Your task is to look at a given git diff that
represents a Python code change, linter
feedback and code smells detected in the code
change, and a corresponding review comment
about the diff. You need to rate how concise,
comprehensive, and relevant a review is and
whether it touches upon all the important
topics, code smells, vulnerabilities, and
issues in the code change.

Code Change:
{code_change}


Code Smells:
{code_smell_detector_messages}


Linter Messages:
{linter_messages}


Review Comment:
{review_comment}


You should first generate a step-by-step list
of all the topics the review should cover like
code smells, issues that would be flagged by a
linter, security vulnerabilities, etc. Also,
the review should cover aspects like bugs, code
security, code readability, maintainability,
memory consumption, performance, good and bad
design patterns, and efficiency introduced in
the code change. Put your analysis under a
section titled \### Topics to be Covered:".

After generating the list above you should
again think step-by-step about the given review
comment and whether it addresses these topics
and put it under a section called "###
Step-by-Step Analysis of Review Comment:". Then
based on your step-by-step analysis you should
generate a score ranging from 1 (minimum value)
to 5 (maximum value) each about how
comprehensive, concise, and relevant a review
is. A review getting a score of 5 on
comprehensiveness addresses nearly all the
points in the \### Topics to be Covered:"
section while a review scoring 1 addresses none
of them. A review getting a score of 5 on
conciseness only covers the topics in the \###
Topics to be Covered:" section without wasting
time on off-topic information while a review
getting a score of 1 is entirely off-topic.
Finally, a review scoring 5 on relevance is
both concise and comprehensive while a review
scoring 1 is neither concise nor comprehensive,
effectively making relevance a combined score
of conciseness and comprehensiveness. You
should give your final rating in a section
titled \### Final Scores:". If a review scores
4 on comprehensiveness, 2 on conciseness, and 3
on relevance give the final scores as shown
below (please follow the exact format).

### Final Scores:
```
{"comprehensiveness": 4, "conciseness": 2,
"relevance": 3}
```
Now start your analysis starting with the \###
Topics to be Covered:", followed by "###
Step-by-Step Analysis of Review Comment:" and
ending with the \### Final Scores:".

### Topics to be Covered:
{topics_to_be_covered}
